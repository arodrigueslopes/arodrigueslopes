- âš¡ Hi, Iâ€™m @hdb5619hdb, Cyber Security Consultant and Pentester Wi-Fi and Web Applications.
- âš¡ I am interested in sharing and learning more about Pentest Wi-Fi, Web & Mobile Apps. I am also interested in learning Python focused on Information Security.
- âš¡ I'm currently learning "Wi-Fi Hacking" and "Pentest Mobile".
- âš¡ I try to collaborate, initially, with documentation and tips from books about Pentest and Vulnerability Analysis and, later on, with exploits written in Python, and more advanced topics of a Pentest(er).
- âš¡ How to reach me ... studying, testing, researching Cyber Security and... playing guitar every day!
- ðŸ’¥ Your security, my passionðŸ’¥
