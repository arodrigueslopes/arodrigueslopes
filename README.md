- ⚡ Hi, I’m @arodrigueslopes, Cyber Security Consultant and Pentester Wi-Fi and Web Applications; owner of Def2Sec Cyber Security Services.
- ⚡ I am interested in sharing and learning more about Pentest Wi-Fi, Web & Mobile Apps. I am also interested in learning Python focused on Information Security.
- ⚡ I'm currently learning "Wi-Fi Hacking Enterprise" on Desec Security (desecsecurity.com). Then I will perform the "Pentest Mobile" also in Desec Security.
- ⚡ I try to collaborate, initially, with documentation and tips from books about Pentest and Vulnerability Analysis and, later on, with exploits written in Python, and more advanced topics of a Pentest(er).
